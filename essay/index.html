        “What is the future of the internet, in 50-100 years from now?”  This is the burning question that everyone has as technology advances further and further as the years go by, with the use of AI getting better but also more controversial and how powerful social media in the current society can be when used properly.  What do I think the future of the internet is in 50-100 years from now? I think it will be pretty similar to how cartoons picture the future, with technology and knowledge progressing having these techno like buildings and ways of transportation that weren't currently possible.
	<p class="paragraph">On the topic of AI in the future of the internet, it will most likely keep growing as the world does, it’s currently widely used by not just people but also businesses and the gaming industry which I find the different industries will find ways to continue using ai as it progresses. I hope for the future that they find a way for AI not to take art from the artists that make them and change it into something else. A way to report users who use others' art and AI to make it their own. It does have practical purposes that in the future will better different industries , maybe even be an industry standard in the future.
        </p>
<p class="paragraph">Not just dealing with AI, but I believe the future of the internet will outgrow its limited use within computer screens but even something more than it currently is. The Internet is expanding more than it currently is at, the more information and culture that get shared the more knowledgeable the internet will be as technology progresses, social media will always be more controversial on some things and that will probably never change, it may be more controversial as it continues to progress.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Going back to the future of the internet, while we currently have a way to view old websites that are no longer available today or old versions of current sites, I wonder if the internet will be advanced enough that this system will still be able to run these older sites forever so that those in the future can see the internet of today or will they completely change it where sites are hosted differently due to the change or upgrade in technology? Will the internet look completely different than it currently is? How far will things like AI tie into the internet more than it already is? So many questions that can’t be answered at the current time as the internet expands and changes to fit the needs of the current time. Sites like Wayback Machine is what I refer to when mentioning these old sites as its often used to visit past sites that are no longer available due to updates to the domain or have become obsolete due to technology over time. An example can be youtube, while the older versions of the site are no longer available and can only go back a few years some part of me hopes something like this site continues within the future or something similar pops up to show the future of the internet how it was before was niche and trendy for the different time periods.</p>

 <p class="paragraph">    Social media and music in general could change on the internet as there are so many different apps today that users use to consume their media especially with the ability to use streaming services nowadays instead of using cable, using spotify vs. apple music vs. amazon music, or even the fight between streaming services as well. However the more expensive the things get the less likely the public will want to use these items!</p>

<p class="paragraph">In conclusion, this is how I envision the future of the internet, more advanced and possibly more accessible than it already is, with some safety precautions, which is currently lacking in some ways in today’s world. I believe the more technology and the internet improve the more likely that idea could come to fruition!
